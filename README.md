# Musical Escape Room
This short game was created for my bachelor's project in Music Technology in 2020. It was made with Unity 2020.3.33f1 and audio was implemented using FMOD Studio 2.00.08.

The purpose of the project was to explore different ways sound and musical ideas can be used in game mechanics.

The goal in the game is to complete 4 different puzzles. When you have completed them, you can exit the door, and the game is then finished.
