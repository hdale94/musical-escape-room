# Musical Escape Room
This short game was created for my bachelor's project in Music Technology in 2020. The purpose of the project was to explore different ways sound and musical ideas can be used in game mechanics.

The project was made with Unity 2020.3.33f1 and audio was implemented using FMOD Studio 2.00.08.

The goal in the game is to complete 4 different puzzles, and when you have completed them, you can exit the room which finishes the game.
